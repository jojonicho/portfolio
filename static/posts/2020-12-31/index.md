My software engineering internship journey fails (and successes) in 2021!

## Google SG (STEP) - **Rejected** (Online Test)

- Technical Test: 2 questions, 1 hour ish

**Where I Failed:**

To be honest with you, this was only for click bait. I failed the online test miserably.

---

## GDP Labs (SDE) - **Offer**

- Technical Test: 4 questions, 2 hours
- Technical Interview: 2 questions + 1 OOP

**Where I Succeed:**

Prior knowledge of `BFS` and `Bucket Sort`.

**Takeaways**

Technical test was pretty hard, solved 2 and partially solved 2.

## Garena SG (BE) - **Rejected** (Technical Interview 1)

- Technical Test: 2 questions, 1 hour
- Technical Interview: 1 question

**Where I Failed:**

Didn't know how to solve leetcode's `Basic Calculator`.

**Takeaways:**

Interviewer was super nice, actually learned alot about postfix and infix notation.

## Shopee ID (SAP) - **Rejected** (HR Interview)

- Online Test: UTBK TPA style test
- HR Interview: 10 minutes

**Where I Failed:**

> Recruiter: Why did you apply for SAP?<br>
> Me: Oh, I heard from my friend that it's good

That was my blunder, that should've been my supporting answer. A good answers would've been _I see SAP as an opportunity for me to grow and experience real-work projects._ and then my original answer.

**Takeaways:**

Super fast HR round, SAP doesn't have an engineering program.

---

## Microsoft ID (Specialist) - **Offer**

- HR Interview
- Lead & Director Interview

**Takeaways:**

Offer deadline was super fast, decided not to take it as I wanted to experience more interviews (it was worth it). Plus, this was not a Software Engineering position. Also, surprisingly no technical questions.

---

## Dekoruma (SE) - **Offer**

- Technical Interview: 2 questions

**Where I Succeed:**

Referral to get the interview, thx Ko Jojo & Ko Stephen. Knowledge of `Merge Sort`, `Hash Map`, and `Set`. Interviewer was super nice, gave subtle yet very heplful hints.

## Reflection

It's 2 am, I don't even know why I'm writing this now.
